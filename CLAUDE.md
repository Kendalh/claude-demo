# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Repository Status

This appears to be an empty or newly initialized repository with no source code, configuration files, or documentation present. The directory contains only the basic folder structure.

## Development Setup

Since this is a blank repository, the specific development workflow will depend on what type of project gets initialized here. Common next steps would typically include:

- Initializing a package manager (npm, yarn, pip, cargo, etc.)
- Setting up a basic project structure
- Adding build and development scripts
- Configuring linting and testing tools

## Architecture

No code architecture exists yet as this is an empty repository.

## Notes for Future Development

When code is added to this repository, this CLAUDE.md file should be updated to include:
- Build commands and development workflow
- Code architecture and project structure
- Testing and linting commands
- Any project-specific conventions or patterns
